# E-Commerce Application: Backend Web Development Project

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

**Brief Overview:**
This project involves developing a fully functional e-commerce platform utilizing the MERN stack ‚Äî MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The application will be built using React's Create React App (CRA) for the front-end, MongoDB as the database solution, and Node.js with Express to handle the back-end server operations.

The project will be split into two main areas: **Frontend** (client-side) and **Backend** (server-side) development. 

- **Frontend:** We will be creating various pages for user interaction, including:
  - **Login Page**
  - **Sign Up Page**
  - **Forgot Password Page**
  - **Home Page**
  - **Product Display Page**
  - **Cart Page**
  - **Address Page**
  - **Payment Page**
  - **Order Confirmation Page**
  - **Order History Page**
  - **Help Page**
  - **Error Page**
  - Detailed Product Pages

- **Backend:** The server will interact with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to handle data management. We will be using the Mongoose library to interact with the database and define schemas for data consistency. To manage communication between the front-end and the back-end, we will implement APIs that allow for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using HTTP methods like `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

We‚Äôll integrate **bcrypt** for password hashing to ensure user data security, and the entire project will follow best practices for backend structure, focusing on scalability and maintainability.

### **Milestone 2: Frontend Development (Login Page)**

For this milestone, we successfully created the **Login Page** using React's Create React App (CRA). To improve the user interface and design, we will be updating the layout with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and incorporate **React-Icons** for intuitive icons. Tailwind CSS will help us streamline the design process with its utility-first classes, making the UI responsive and visually appealing.

The Login Page will include fields for the user's email and password, and will handle form validation, state management, and error handling for incorrect login attempts. React Icons will be utilized for visual appeal and ease of use, enhancing the overall experience.

### **Milestone 3: Backend Structure and Initial Setup**

At this stage, we‚Äôve laid the foundation for the backend by setting up the directory structure for the project. The backend is structured as follows:

- **`src/` Directory:** Contains all source code files for the server.
  - **`config/`**: Stores environment configuration files like `.env` for MongoDB URL and the server port.
  - **`controllers/`**: Defines functions to handle incoming requests for various routes.
  - **`database/`**: Contains the MongoDB connection logic in `db.js`.
  - **`middleware/`**: Houses custom middleware functions such as `error.js` for centralized error handling.
  - **`model/`**: Contains Mongoose models for the database schema.
  - **`routers/`**: Defines route handlers for different API endpoints.
  - **`utils/`**: Stores utility functions, including the `ErrorHandler.js` to manage application-level errors.

In the **`index.js`** file, we imported Express, initialized the app, and set up basic routing and server listening. We can now handle HTTP requests through `app.get` and set the server to listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

### **Milestone 4: Backend Structure and Initial Setup**
creating user model, user controller and Multer support


 ## Milestone 6
: Backend Structure and Initial Setup** Password Encryption and User Data Storage

Password Hashing:

Implement bcrypt to hash the user's password during the signup process. Ensure that the hashed password is stored in the database instead of the plaintext version to enhance security. User Data Storage:

Save all relevant user information (e.g., name, email, etc.) in the database. Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the password by ensuring it remains encrypted throughout the process.

--- 

## Milestone 7
Create Login Endpoint:

Accept user credentials (email/username and password). Retrieve the corresponding user from the database. Validate Password:

Use bcrypt to hash the entered password. Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.

## Milestone 8
In this milestone we created two components called Home.jsx and productcard.jsx. product card.jsx is the template used in home.jsx to map out all the products and display them. We also added routes to the home.jsx to display it when the page loads. Based on the number of products the products are mapped and displayed.



## Milestone 9: Create Product Form
